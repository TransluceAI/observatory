# Transluce

Transluce is an independent research lab building open, scalable technology for understanding AI systems and steering them in the public interest.

This repository hosts code for two projects:

- [Neuron Descriptions](https://transluce.org/neuron-descriptions), which automatically generates high-quality descriptions of language model neurons;
- The [Monitor](https://transluce.org/observability-interface) interface, which helps humans observe, understand, and steer the internal computations of language models.

## Installation

First clone this repo:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:TransluceAI/observatory.git
```

### Installing `luce`

Next, we'll install `luce`, a command-line tool that manages project environments and dependencies. It will significantly simplify setup for downstream projects.

To install `luce`, add the following to your shell profile (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`):

```bash
# ... existing shell config
export TRANSLUCE_HOME=<absolute_path_to_repo>
source $TRANSLUCE_HOME/lib/lucepkg/scripts/shellenv.sh
```

Make sure to `source` your shell profile:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc  # for bash users
# OR
source ~/.zshrc   # for zsh users
```

Then run:

```bash
luce uv install  # install uv package manager
luce install     # install base environment
```

to install the `uv` package manager and base virtual environment, respectively. The base venv includes basic packages like the Jupyter kernel, pre-commit, etc.

### Setting up environment variables

Finally, clone the `.env.template` file to `.env` and fill in the missing values.

```bash
cp .env.template .env
```

These variables are always required:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_ORG`: OpenAI API key and organization ID.
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: Anthropic API key.
- `HF_TOKEN`: Required for accessing gated models (e.g., Llama-3.1) on HuggingFace.

The rest of the variables are only required for running the NeuronDB or Monitor; you can safely ignore them for now.

## Getting Started

### Neuron Descriptions

See the [description generation README](project/expgen/README.md) for generating neuron descriptions automatically.

### Monitor

See the [Monitor README](project/monitor/README.md) for instructions on how to set up a local development environment.

## Using `luce`

### Package and environment management

Each folder under `lib/` and `project/` has its own venv. Use `luce` to:

```bash
# Install all dependencies
luce install --all

# Install and activate a specific package
luce install <package_name>

# Activate a venv and cd to its directory
luce activate <package_name>

# Deactivate the current package
deactivate
```

You may need to use `--force` to reinstall a package that already exists; this removes `poetry.lock`:

```bash
luce install --force <package_name>
```

### Using Jupyter notebooks

We include utilities to register Jupyter kernels into the top-level environment. To register a kernel for a package, run:

```bash
luce nb register <package_name>
```

To start a notebook server that can call any of the registered kernels, run:

```bash
luce nb start --port <port>
```

You'll get a readout of the notebook server URL, which you can use to connect to the notebook server via the web or an IDE.
